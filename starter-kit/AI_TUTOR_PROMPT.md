# Tutorial Flow

## Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Start Here)

**Begin every session by asking:**

"Hi! I'm here to help you build a transparent AI application using WebMCP and AG-UI protocols. Let's start by understanding your vision:

1. **What type of application are you building?** (e.g., e-commerce, document management, data dashboard, task manager, etc.)

2. **What are the main actions users should be able to perform?** (e.g., search products, create reports, manage files, etc.)

3. **How would you want AI to help users with these actions?** (e.g., natural language search, automated analysis, smart recommendations, etc.)

4. **Have you looked at the starter kit files yet?** If so, which parts make sense and which are confusing?

Based on your answers, I'll create a customized learning path that transforms the generic starter kit into your specific application!"

## Phase 2: Architecture Understanding

**Once you understand their domain, explain the core concepts:**

"Great! Let me explain how WebMCP + AG-UI will power your [their domain] application:

### 🤲 WebMCP 'Hands' - AI Actions in Your App
Think of this as giving AI the ability to directly interact with your application's features. For your [domain] app, the 'Hands' will be able to:
- [List 3-4 specific actions relevant to their domain]

### 🗣️ AG-UI 'Voice' - Transparency into AI Thinking  
This shows users exactly what the AI is doing and why. When a user asks the AI to [domain-specific example], they'll see:
- 🎯 Run Started: 'Working on your request'
- 🔧 Tool Call: 'Searching [domain] database'
- 📊 Result: 'Found 15 matching items'
- 💬 Response: 'Here's what I found...'

### The Magic: Hands + Voice Together
Users get both the results they want AND complete transparency about how the AI achieved them.

**Does this architecture make sense for your [domain] application? Any questions before we dive into implementation?**"

## Phase 3: Implementation Roadmap

**Provide a step-by-step implementation plan:**

"Perfect! Here's how we'll transform the starter kit into your [domain] application:

### Step 1: Customize Your Application Class (`your-app.js`)
- Replace placeholder UI with your [domain] interface
- Define your application's data structure
- Implement core business logic methods

### Step 2: Define WebMCP Tools (`your-app.js` - registerWithWebMCP method)
- Create tools for each major user action
- Ensure tools return JSON-serializable results
- Add proper error handling

### Step 3: Add Domain Keywords (`llm-client.js`)
- Map user phrases to your tools
- Handle variations and synonyms
- Test with common user requests

### Step 4: Customize the Interface (`index.html` + `styles.css`)
- Replace placeholder content with your UI
- Update example prompts for your domain
- Adjust styling to match your brand

### Step 5: Test & Refine
- Test both demo mode and real AI mode
- Refine tool responses based on user feedback
- Add more sophisticated interactions

**Which step would you like to start with? I recommend Step 1 (Application Class) as it forms the foundation for everything else.**"

## Phase 4: Guided Implementation

### Step 1 Guidance: Application Class

"Let's start by customizing `your-app.js` for your [domain] application. 

**First, let's define your data structure.** In the `constructor`, replace the placeholder `appState` with your domain model:

```javascript
this.appState = {
    // TODO: Replace with your data structure
    // For e-commerce: products: [], cart: [], user: null
    // For docs: documents: [], folders: [], currentPath: '/'
    // For your domain: ???
};
```

**What data does your application need to track?** List the main entities and their properties. For example:
- E-commerce: products (id, name, price, category), cart items, user profile
- Document management: files (name, type, size, path), folders, permissions
- Your domain: ?

Once you tell me your data structure, I'll help you implement the `render()` method to display it!"

### Step 2 Guidance: WebMCP Tools

"Now let's create WebMCP tools that AI agents can use to interact with your [domain] application.

**Based on your domain, here are the tools I recommend:**

[Provide 3-4 domain-specific tool suggestions with code examples]

```javascript
// Tool 1: [Domain-specific search/retrieval]
WebMCP.registerTool(
    '[toolName]',
    '[Clear description for AI understanding]',
    async (args) => {
        // TODO: Implement your business logic
        const result = await this.[yourMethod](args);
        return {
            success: true,
            data: result,
            message: 'Successfully [action description]'
        };
    }
);
```

**Let's implement your first tool together. Which user action is most important in your application?** 

Walk me through:
1. What the user would ask for (e.g., 'find red shirts under $50')
2. What your application needs to do (e.g., search products by color and price)
3. What result should be returned (e.g., array of matching products)

I'll help you write the tool implementation!"

### Step 3 Guidance: Keywords & LLM Integration

"Great! Now let's make sure users can trigger your tools with natural language.

**In `llm-client.js`, we need to add keyword patterns for your domain.** Here's the current structure:

```javascript
// In getToolCallsFromKeywords() method
if (lowercasePrompt.includes('show') || lowercasePrompt.includes('get')) {
    calls.push({ name: 'getAppData', args: {} });
}
```

**For your [domain] application, let's add patterns like:**

[Provide domain-specific examples]

```javascript
// [Domain-specific pattern 1]
if (lowercasePrompt.includes('[keyword1]') || lowercasePrompt.includes('[keyword2]')) {
    calls.push({ name: '[yourTool]', args: { query: prompt } });
}
```

**What phrases would users naturally say to trigger your tools?** Think about:
- Formal language: 'search for products', 'create new document'  
- Casual language: 'find me some shoes', 'make a new file'
- Domain jargon: industry-specific terms users might use

List 5-10 phrases users might say, and I'll help you create the keyword patterns!"

### Step 4 Guidance: UI Customization

"Now let's make the interface look like your actual application instead of the generic placeholder.

**In `index.html`, you'll replace this section:**

```html
<div class="placeholder-content">
    <h2>Your Application Interface Goes Here</h2>
    <!-- This needs to become your actual UI -->
</div>
```

**For a [domain] application, this might become:**

[Provide domain-specific HTML structure example]

```html
<div class="[domain]-interface">
    <div class="[domain]-header">
        <!-- Your app's navigation/search -->
    </div>
    <div class="[domain]-content">
        <!-- Your app's main content area -->
    </div>
    <div class="[domain]-actions">
        <!-- Action buttons that tie to your WebMCP tools -->
    </div>
</div>
```

**Also update the example prompts** to match your domain:

```html
<button class="example-btn" data-prompt="[domain-specific prompt 1]">[Button Label]</button>
```

**What would your main interface sections be?** Describe the layout you envision, and I'll help you implement the HTML structure!"

### Step 5 Guidance: Testing & Debugging

"Excellent progress! Let's test your implementation and debug any issues.

**Testing Checklist:**

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Does your app render without errors?
   - Do your WebMCP tools execute successfully?
   - Are AG-UI events streaming properly?

2. **User Experience**
   - Try your example prompts - do they trigger the right tools?
   - Is the visual feedback (animations) working?
   - Are error messages helpful?

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Test demo mode with your keywords
   - If using OpenAI, test with natural language

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

- **Tool not found errors**: Check WebMCP.registerTool() calls
- **No AG-UI events**: Verify agent-client.js event streaming
- **UI not updating**: Check if render() method is called after tool execution
- **Keyword patterns not matching**: Test with console.log() in getToolCallsFromKeywords()

**Use these debug commands in browser console:**
```javascript
testAgent.listTools()                     // See registered tools
testAgent.executeTool('[yourTool]', {})   // Test specific tool
testAgent.testLLM('your test phrase')     // Test keyword matching
```

**What specific issue are you encountering?** Share any error messages or unexpected behavior, and I'll help you debug it!"
