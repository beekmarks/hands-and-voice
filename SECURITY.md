# üîê Security Notice

## IMPORTANT: API Key Security

The API key you shared in your request should be **rotated immediately** for security reasons.

### Why API keys should never be shared:
- ‚úÖ **Financial Impact**: Unauthorized usage charges
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limits**: Potential service disruption  
- ‚úÖ **Security Risk**: Access to your OpenAI account
- ‚úÖ **Compliance**: Violates OpenAI's terms of service

### How to secure your API keys:

1. **Rotate the exposed key immediately**:
   - Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Delete the compromised key
   - Generate a new one

2. **Best practices for API keys**:
   - Never commit keys to version control
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Implement rate limiting and monitoring
   - Use separate keys for development/production
   - Set usage limits and alerts

3. **For this POC application**:
   - Keys are stored in browser localStorage only
   - Never transmitted to any third-party servers
   - Cleared when you click "Use Keyword Matching"
   - Can be safely entered for local testing

### Production Considerations

For a real application, implement:
- Server-side API key management
- User authentication and authorization
- Request logging and monitoring
- Rate limiting per user
- Secure environment variable storage

**Remember**: Treat API keys like passwords - keep them secret, rotate them regularly, and monitor their usage.
